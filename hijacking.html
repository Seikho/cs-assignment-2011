<b>Session hijacking</b> involves a hacker gaining access to session information (namely cookies) which contains the necessary information used to authenticate to a website (such as Facebook). Once the hacker has this information they simply (and automatically) imitate the victim and gain access to the website that the victim was accessing ("What is Cookie Hijacking?", n.d.).<p />

These particular attacks are more designed to work on wireless networks, but can still on wired networks (Ahmed, 2010).<p />
Any website that has personal information will require you to log in. Ensure that when you log in to and browse these websites, you are using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS encrpyts and decrypts data whereas standard HTTP sends it in plain text. This form of protection completely protects your sessions from being hijacked (Kyrnin, n.d.). <p />

When you can see an image of a padlock in the address bar or see "HTTPS://" before the address of the website you are logged in to, you are using HTTPS. There are other indicators, but these are the most popular in browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer. <p />

<h2>#Developer Comments#<br />
I was a little upset that this was the last section. By this stage I had a lot of ideas I wanted to squeeze in to the site.<br />
I had momentum up to this point and this section came together nicely.<br />
I was able to use the hilarious character, exaggeration, hypothetical humour and get in some final profile shots of the characters. I was really happy after I finished this to have this as the final section.<p />
The bottom image of Google Chrome was simply a result of thinking that users might find it too hard to visualise the address bar and the padlock.<p />
I avoided using a farewell page here as the page would then completely change into a presentation instead of a informative website.
