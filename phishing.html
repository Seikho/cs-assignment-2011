<p />
<b>Phishing scams</b> are usually in the form of an email and are designed to appear to be sent by a legitimate website or organisation (such as Facebook or your bank). These phishing emails will request personal information from you. You'll then be directed to another seemingly legitimate website be requested to enter your login details. However, since the website is fake, the information is sent directly to the scammer (Phishing, 2011).

<h3><b>How can I protect myself from phishing scams?</b><p />
Keep in mind that websites will very rarely (if ever) request information from you through an email. Administrators of games or social networking websites will never request your username and password. Much in the same way your banking institution will not ask you for your credit card number.<p />
You should always be suspicious of any email or message that is requesting personal information from you.<p />
Should a message appear authentic, never follow the links provided inside the email or message. Instead, open up your browser and go to the website yourself.<p />
Never fill out forms that are inside emails requesting any sort of personal information.<p />
Check the address bar of the website you are at. Ensure that it is indeed the correct spelling of where you intend to be. For example: http://www.facebook.com is NOT http://www.faecbook.com.<p />
Software is available that can scan your emails and will often recognise phishing emails and alert you ("Consumer Advice: How to Avoid Phishing Scams", n.d.).

<h2>#Developer Comments#<br />
Despite using an "it's obvious" style of humour on throughout the site, I've intentionally exaggerated the style here.<p />
I wanted to ingrain that phishing scams are obvious, but not insult the reader. I wanted them to LEARN that spotting phishing scams are easy.<p />
The final panel in the first comic was originally a filler as I ran out of ideas, but ended up being character building and carried on my "Employee of the month" theme from an earlier section. I was easily able to carry this theme on into future sections if I wanted to.
