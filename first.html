This website has been designed to be an entertaining teaching tool to teach readers how to protect themselves against popular attacks. <p />
I hope you enjoy my artwork and learn something new while having a bit of a chuckle and don't forget to hover your mouse over the comics for a little hidden comment!<p />

<h2>#Developer Comments#<br />
The thought process behind this comic being on the front page is immidiately introducing the reader to the main character that they'll be seeing through-out the site.<br />
Secondly, it is to immidately establish the fact that humour is present. Although the entire website appears academic (such as the background behind lined paper, the content being enclosed on a blackboard, etc), I immidiately want to make the atmosphere light-hearted and not give the impression this is just another mundane induction.<br /><br />
The website should feel like it's interactive. By that I mean all the text will seem like the narrator is speaking to directly to the reader. <br />
This constant theme should assist in removing the formal learning atmosphere and keep the reader interested.<p />

The final design was the result of a conversation I was having with a friend at work. Strangely we were discussing his work project and this assignment. He randomly mentioned a chalkboard when I said the word "academic" and this idea just seemed perfect. After messing around a lot with my stylesheet, I settled on this design.<p />

The logo was actually incredibly difficult to come up with. I played with a lot of designs before I settled on the chalk font.<br />
This was where I was going to show wrecked (hand drawn) computers, but it just never looked write on the green background.<br />
After making this simple logo in (what felt like) under 2 minutes, I was incredibly happy with it and left it.<p />

An interesting tidbit of information.. The only tools used to create this entire page were Notepad, Photoshop, a mechanical with 2B leads and art paper I was given for my birthday 10 years ago.
