A <b>virus</b> is a variant of malicious software that manifests itself in your computer. It is designed with a sinister purpose in mind. They can: delete or corrupt data on your computer,  replicate themselves, spread themselves amongst your network, allow your computer to be remotely controlled, send itself to your contacts and many more things ("What is a computer virus?", 2006).

<h3>A quick case study: <b>The Koobface Virus</b><p />

The <b>Koobface virus</b> is a virus that was designed to target Facebook in particular. This virus appeared on your Facebook homepage as a friend posting a video to you that often claimed to feature you. This link would take you to a bogus website.<p />

This bogus website would look like <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a> and would claim you need to update your Flash player. Once you have downloaded and run this file, you have been infected by the virus.<p />

Once installed the user is now able to: contact users on your Facebook, steal information, intercept internet traffic, download additional files (such as fake anti-virus software) and much more (Chien & Shearer, 2010).

<b>How can I protect myself from viruses?</b><p />
First and foremost, have some form of anti-virus software installed and kept up-to-date.<p />
Don't open email attachments from sources you aren't expecting files from. Email is an incredibly popular method of spreading viruses and rely on users erring on the side of curiousity to successfully infect.<p />

Do not believe the sender/return address. Email spoofing is an incredibly common method employed to fool users into believing emails are from a trusted source.<p />

Check the address bar to make sure you browsing where you think you are. Although a website may appear legitimate, it could be fake and trying to convince you to download a virus. If you're trying to view a youtube video, ensure you are indeed at http://www.youtube.com.<p />

Avoid downloading pirated software. Pirated software often contains hidden viruses and other nasty malicious software inside their packages. Stick to legitimate vendors for your software. As well as being risky, software piracy is also illegal and has severe consequences. (Spanbauer, 2004).

<h2>#Developer Comments#<br />
This section was particularly difficult to demonstrate. I had already used software piracy and emails. I decided to use a specific virus example, but even that proved difficult to fill 4 panels.<p />
When in doubt, resort to exaggeration. Before I even began the assignment and this was all a concept, I had a computer blowing up in mind. I decided to use this ace here since I already had some ideas for the final section.<p />
The rest just fell in to place.
